## Documentation Guidelines

When a new business rule is mentioned:

1. Add it to this document immediately
2. Use a concise format (single line or brief paragraph)
3. Maintain precision - do not lose important details for brevity
4. Include rationale where it adds clarity

## Villager Interactions

**Conversation triggers**: Conversations with villagers should only start when pressing the "C" key (when near a villager) or when right-clicking on a villager. Left-click should not trigger conversations.
