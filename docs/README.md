# Note Village

Transform your Obsidian vault into a living 2D pixel art village where your notes become villagers you can explore and interact with using AI.

## Key Features

- **Living Village**: Your notes become villagers that wander around a procedurally-generated village
- **AI Conversations**: Chat with any villager using Claude AI to explore your note content
- **Tag-Based Zones**: The village organizes itself based on your vault's tag structure
- **Pixel Art Style**: Beautiful JRPG-inspired 2D graphics with animations
- **Interactive Exploration**: Navigate the village using keyboard or click-to-move

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Open **Settings → Note Village** and configure your Anthropic API key (for AI conversations)
3. Use the command **Note Village: Open village** or click the village icon in the ribbon
4. Explore your vault as a village and talk to your notes!

## How It Works

1. **Vault Analysis**: The plugin scans your vault for notes and their tags
2. **Zone Generation**: Top tags become zones in the village layout
3. **Villager Placement**: Each note becomes a villager assigned to its primary tag's zone
4. **Village Building**: Roads, houses, decorations, and boundaries are procedurally generated
5. **AI Integration**: When you interact with a villager, Claude AI uses the note content to respond
