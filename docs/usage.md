## Interacting with Villagers

Villagers are your notes, wandering within their zone. Each villager:

- Has a unique pixel art appearance
- Displays their note title on hover
- Stays within their tag's zone boundaries

### Starting Conversations

1. Move close to a villager (within interaction range)
2. Press **C** or right-click the villager
3. The chat dialog opens with the villager's greeting

### Chat Interface

The chat dialog shows:

- **Villager name**: The note title
- **Conversation history**: Previous messages in this session
- **Input field**: Type your message
- **Send button**: Or press Enter to send

### Conversation Tips

- Ask about the note's content
- The AI uses the full note text as context
- Conversations can be saved to your vault (see Configuration)

## Understanding the Village

### Central Plaza

The village center features:

- A decorative fountain
- Benches and gathering areas
- Roads connecting to all zones

### Zones

Each zone represents a top tag from your vault:

- Notes with that tag become villagers in the zone
- Zones are arranged radially around the plaza
- Zone size is proportional to note count

### Decorations

The village includes:

- Trees and bushes
- Flower beds
- Houses (proportional to villagers)
- Fences and boundaries
- Forest border around the world edge

## Regenerating the Village

If you want a fresh village layout:

1. Open settings
2. Change the **Village seed** to any new value
3. Reload the village view

The same seed always generates the same layout.
